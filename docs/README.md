# kitaBantu Mobile Backend

This repository contains the **mobile backend service** for the `kitaBantu` mobile application, originally developed for **kitaBantu Indonesia**. The project has since been extended and maintained with improved documentation, architecture, and a cleaner developer experience.

This backend powers the mobile application, handling authentication, freelancer orders, real-time chat, and payment workflows.

## üì¶ Architecture Note: RabbitMQ Integration

RabbitMQ is intended to act as a message broker for syncing data between the **web** and **mobile** backend services.  
As `kitaBantu Indonesia` plans to maintain separate backend systems for each platform, RabbitMQ was selected for:

- High performance and low latency
- Easy Laravel integration
- Strong community and plugin ecosystem
- Scalability for future microservices and asynchronous tasks
